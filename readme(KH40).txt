WorkingFloor2_Blur, a version of WorkingFloor2 edited by KH40 with new function to make the reflection blurry


HOW TO USE:
	Load WorkingFloor2_Blur.pmx (it has the same role as the .x file in the original version, but now with sliders for configurations, and a bone to move/rotate the surface)


NOTICES:
	- Make WorkingFloor2_Blur.pmx be at the bottom in the "model display order" table, or else it won't look right when the surface is semi-transparent
	- In case the effect causes low frame rate (bc you run serveral surfaces at once, or your computer is simply a potato), you can change the resolution of the reflection by changing the #define Resolution value in WorkingFloor2_Blur.fx. Reasonably low resolution should still look decent when being blurred, and it increases the frame rate

RULES:
	- Feel free to edit, and distribute the edit
	- Don't re-distribute the effect without changing anything. Instead, link to this page
	- Credit 針金P and KH40 when you use the effect, and when you distribute edits of the effect
