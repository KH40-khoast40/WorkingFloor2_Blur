# WorkingFloor2_Blur
An edited version of WorkingFloor2 by 針金P, with new function to make the reflection blurry

Original version can be found here: https://hariganep.seesaa.net/

# Usage
Load **WorkingFloor2_Blur.pmx** *(it has the same role as the .x file in the original version, but now with sliders for options, and a bone to move/rotate the surface)*

# Notices
- Make **WorkingFloor2_Blur.pmx** be **last** in the "model display order" table

- In case the effect causes low frame rate *(bc you run serveral surfaces at once, or your computer is simply a potato)*, you can change the resolution of the reflection by changing the **#define Resolution** value in **WorkingFloor2_Blur.fx**. Reasonably low resolution should still look decent when being blurred, and it increases the frame rate

# Rules
- Feel free to edit, and distribute the edit
- Don't re-distribute the effect without changing anything. Instead, link to this page
- Credit 針金P and KH40 when you use the effect, and when you distribute edits of the effect
